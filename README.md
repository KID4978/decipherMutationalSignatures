# decipherMutationalSignatures
Deciphering mutational signatures with alternative algorithms

Mutational signature deciphering based on source code from previous publications (Alexandrov L. B. et al.) but provides
simpler command line to run. Besides, it provides several other algorithms. This program is binary code compiled via mcc,
so you can run it with MCR, which is freely available. This proggram is tested with MCR_R2013a.
